        <ol>
          <li>
            Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add
            onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add
            crushed tomatoes, chicken broth, wine, garlic powder, onion powder,
            oregano, Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and sugar; season
            with salt and pepper. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and
            simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 15
            minutes. Keep warm until needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted
            water to a boil. Add rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until
            tender yet firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the same time, start the chicken: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees
            F (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set out three large mixing bowls for breading chicken. Combine
            flour, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in
            the first bowl. Whisk together eggs and milk in the second bowl.
            Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning,
            1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the third bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and flatten with a
            meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Dredge a chicken breast in
            flour mixture and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then coat
            with bread crumb mixture. Place onto a plate. Repeat to bread
            remaining chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill a large, cast iron skillet with 1 inch oil; heat over
            medium-high heat until oil is hot but not smoking. Add breaded
            chicken in batches; cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per
            side. Transfer chicken to the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle
            mozzarella and Parmesan over chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until chicken reaches an internal
            temperature of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the cheeses have
            melted, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plate pasta portions. Stir basil into sauce and ladle over pasta.
            Top each portion with chicken.
