    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion
        and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add crushed
        tomatoes, chicken broth, wine, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano,
        Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and sugar; season with salt and
        pepper. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring
        occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 15 minutes. Keep warm until
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to
        a boil. Add rigatoni and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet
        firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the same time, start the chicken: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F
        (230 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set out three large mixing bowls for breading chicken. Combine flour,
        1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and pepper in the first
        bowl. Whisk together eggs and milk in the second bowl. Combine bread
        crumbs, Parmesan cheese, oregano, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon garlic
        powder, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the third bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag and flatten with a
        meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch. Dredge a chicken breast in flour
        mixture and shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture, then coat with bread
        crumb mixture. Place onto a plate. Repeat to bread remaining chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill a large, cast iron skillet with 1 inch oil; heat over medium-high
        heat until oil is hot but not smoking. Add breaded chicken in batches;
        cook until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to
        the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over
        chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until chicken reaches an internal temperature
        of 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) and the cheeses have melted, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plate pasta portions. Stir basil into sauce and ladle over pasta. Top
        each portion with chicken.
      </li>
