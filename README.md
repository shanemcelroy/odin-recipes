This is my first project with The Odin Project! Exciting.

For this project, I'll use the knowledge I gained in the HTML section of the course to build out a basic recipe website.

The skills I should demonstrate through this project are: semantic HTML, and using all the various HTML tags and attributes that were covered in the section.
